title: i386 Docker Virtual Machine-like Containers in Vagrant
---

There are plenty of reasons why what I'm trying to do might be a bad idea, and
I won't bother to go into them, but suffice to say that I know that Docker
isn't really about virtual machines that persist, and I know that it doesn't
really like running on 32-bit machines. That said, I had a linux VM and a
Vagrantfile that could spin up a build environment for a project, and I wanted
to try out Docker as a Vagrant provider, so I did. It was messy, but it worked,
sort of, so here are my notes, in case they help someone else. There were a lot
of bits of this investigation and I've done my best to lay them out in the
right order.

The [Phusion Baseimage](http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/) for Docker
is what you need to get a VM that hangs around without a process active.

Vagrant wrote a bit about using the baseimage in their blog,
[here](https://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-docker-dev-environments.html).
Without those clues, I'd never have got it running in Vagrant.

The SSH key they reference that is built into the Baseimage can be found
[here](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/blob/master/image/insecure_key).

Some kind soul has made a version of the
[Phusion Baseimage](http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/) for i386,
which you can find at [yebyen/baseimage:i386](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/yebyen/baseimage/).

So your Vagrantfile ends up looking like this:

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provider "docker" do |d|
    d.cmd     = ["/sbin/my_init", "--enable-insecure-key"]
    d.image   = "yebyen/baseimage:i386"
    d.has_ssh = true
  end

  config.ssh.username = "root"
  config.ssh.private_key_path = "phusion.key"
end
```
