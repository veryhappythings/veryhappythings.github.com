If you have a string, let's say, "2009-02-19 02:18:00", and you need a unix timestamp, the <a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil">dateutils</a> library is super useful.
You can grab it with <code>sudo easy_install python-dateutil</code> and then you can run your strings through it like so:
<code>dateutil.parser.parse('2009-02-19 02:18:00').strftime('%s')</code>

Why isn't '%s' anywhere to be found in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-behavior">strftime docs</a>? That would make this somewhat easier to figure out.

Note that this returns a string containing the number, not the number itself.
