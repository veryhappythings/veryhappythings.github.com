I spent a while knocking this together once before, then deleted it, so when I set out to find it again, I found this rather handy <a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/wiki/AutoLoadingTips">Guide to Elixir Autoloading</a>.  Thank you, whoever wrote that!

I really don't get why this can't be as simple as <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecord">ActiveRecord</a>, but sure, whatever, Python does like to be complicated.
