title: Executing Tmux Commands
---

Took me a while to figure this out so I thought I'd blog it.  If you're using tmux and know of a command that you want to execute, but it's not bound to anything (the example I had was clear-history) you can type leader-: (So, by default, <code>C-b :</code>) and then type the command's name.

All of the commands can be found in the man page, which is pretty intimidating, but quite complete.
